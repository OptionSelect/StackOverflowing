# StackOverflowing

First attempt at rebuilding the logic behind what makes Stack Overflow work. Implemented basic authentication so that the website requires that users create an account or log in in order to post a question or comment.
I used a Postgres database to store the questions and comments and left room to work on this in the future in terms of question tagging. Bootstrap was utilized to create a basic skeleton for the pages users would see.
